# Second Meeting!

## Members: gessha, exfoxz
## What did we do today?

Today gessha showed exfoxz a CTF(haxdump) and we tried to solve it, but we couldn't do
even a single problem. However, we weren't discouraged by that and we decided to 
learn more about CTFs and come back with a better skill set.

gessha just finished(almost) a wargame on overthewire.org (Bandit) and showed it to exfoxz

exfoxz told gessha of a really cool project idea. The basic idea is for a web service where
scientists can upload their scripts so that other scientists can use them. In exchange,
the other scientists can pay for using the scripts and for the ability process information
on the cloud.

##Comings:
1. exfoxz
    * to speak with professor Spear about the idea
2. gessha
    * to start studying JS seriously

Note: Node.JS is the only real dev lang!
